# Account & Setup FAQ

Common questions about signing up, configuring your organization, managing users, and day-to-day account management in FyneDesk.

## How do I sign up?

Go to [app.fynedesk.io](https://app.fynedesk.io) and create an account with your name, email, and a password. Your organization is created automatically during signup.

## How do I add team members?

Go to **Settings > Team Members** and click **Invite Member**. Enter their email address and select a role (Admin or Agent). They'll receive an invitation email with a link to join your organization.

## Why do I need to invite team members instead of just sharing a login?

FyneDesk uses an invitation-based system to make sure each person has their own account and joins the correct organization. This prevents account fragmentation (someone accidentally creating a separate organization) and maintains a proper audit trail of who did what.

## What are the user roles?

- **Admin:** Full access to everything, including settings, user management, and all features.
- **Agent:** Day-to-day access to tickets, contacts, knowledge base, and reporting.
- **End User:** Limited access for external users who submit and track their own requests through the customer portal.

See [Roles & Permissions](../guides/roles-and-permissions.md) for details.

## Can I change someone's role?

Yes. Admins can change any team member's role from the Team Members page in Settings. The last Admin in an organization cannot be demoted, this prevents lockout.

## How do I deactivate a user?

Admins can deactivate a user from the Team Members page. Deactivated users lose access to the platform, but their ticket history and comments are preserved.

## How do I set up my ticket prefix?

Go to **Settings > Organization** and set your ticket prefix. This is a short code (2-5 characters) that appears before ticket numbers (e.g., SUP-001, HR-042). Choose something that makes sense for your team.

## How do I set up email-to-ticket?

Email-to-ticket is configured automatically when your organization is created. Your support email address (format: support-yourslug@fynedesk.io) is shown in **Settings > Organization**. Share this address with your customers. Any email sent to it becomes a ticket.

## How do I customize my customer portal?

Your customer portal is automatically available at yourcompany.fynedesk.io. Share this URL with your customers so they can submit tickets and search your knowledge base. On paid plans, you can customize branding (logo, colors, welcome message) and use a custom domain.

## Can I have multiple organizations?

Each account belongs to one organization. If you need to manage support for multiple brands or departments, you can use categories and teams within a single organization to organize work.

## How do I change my organization name?

Go to **Settings > Organization** and update the organization name. This affects the display name in navigation, email notifications, and your customer portal.

## How do I configure SLA targets?

Go to **Settings** and find the SLA configuration section. You can set targets for first response time, resolution time, and close time. SLA performance is tracked automatically and visible in reporting dashboards.

## How do I set up categories?

Go to **Settings > Categories** to add, edit, or remove ticket categories. Default categories are created when your organization is set up. Categories help with routing, filtering, and reporting.

## How do I change the theme?

Go to **Settings > Appearance** and choose from 5 color themes: Blue, Slate, Teal, Purple, or Orange. The theme applies across your entire workspace.

## How do I configure notifications?

Users can manage their notification preferences in their profile settings. Notifications can be toggled on or off for events like ticket assigned, new comment, and status changes. See [Notifications](../features/notifications.md) for details.

## Can I delete my account or organization?

Contact FyneDesk support to request account or organization deletion. All associated data (tickets, contacts, knowledge base articles, attachments) will be permanently removed.

## I forgot my password. How do I reset it?

On the login page, click "Forgot Password" and enter your email address. You'll receive an email with a link to set a new password.

## How do I export my data?

Reports and ticket data can be exported from the reporting dashboard. Contact management includes export capabilities for contact records.
