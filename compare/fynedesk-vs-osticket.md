## FAQ

Yes. FyneDesk provides similar ticketing functionality (email-to-ticket, SLAs, custom fields, knowledge base) without requiring you to host, maintain, or secure a server. It also adds AI assist, a customer portal, contact management, and asset tracking.

### Can I switch from osTicket to FyneDesk?
Yes. FyneDesk supports importing contact records and ticket history.

### Does osTicket have AI features?
No. osTicket does not include AI-powered features. FyneDesk includes AI assist on all plans for ticket summarization, response suggestions, draft replies, classification, and customer-facing AI.

Yes. Self-hosting osTicket requires knowledge of PHP, MySQL, web server configuration (Apache/Nginx), SSL certificates, and server security. FyneDesk requires no technical skills.
