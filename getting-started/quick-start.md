# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with FyneDesk in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Sign Up

Go to [app.fynedesk.io](https://app.fynedesk.io) and create your account. You'll be asked for your name, email, and a password. FyneDesk will automatically create your organization.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Organization

After signing in, go to **Settings** to configure:

- **Organization name** — Your company or team name
- **Ticket prefix** — A short code used in ticket numbers (e.g., "SUP" gives you SUP-001, SUP-002)
- **Support email** — Your dedicated email address for email-to-ticket (format: support-yourslug@fynedesk.io)

## Step 3: Invite Your Team

Go to **Settings > Team Members** and invite agents or admins by email. They'll receive an invitation link to join your organization.

- **Admin** — Full access including settings, user management, and all features
- **Agent** — Can create, view, and manage tickets, contacts, and knowledge base articles
- **End User** — Limited access for external users who submit and track their own requests

## Step 4: Create Your First Ticket

Go to **Tickets** and click **New Ticket**. Fill in:

- **Title** — A short description of the issue
- **Description** — Details about the request
- **Priority** — Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Assign to** — Pick a team member or leave unassigned

That's it. Your first ticket is live. From here you can add comments, change status, attach files, and track the full history.
