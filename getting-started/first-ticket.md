# Your First Ticket

Walk through creating, managing, and resolving your first support ticket in FyneDesk.

## Creating a Ticket

1. Go to **Tickets** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Ticket**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Title** — A short summary of the issue (e.g., "Unable to access invoice portal")
   - **Description** — Full details about the request. Be as specific as possible.
   - **Category** — Select the type of request (e.g., Billing, Technical, General)
   - **Priority** — Critical, High, Medium, or Low
   - **Ticket Type** — Request, Incident, or Question
   - **Assign to** — Pick a team member, or leave unassigned for now
   - **Requester** — Link this ticket to an existing contact, or leave blank for internal tickets
4. Click **Create Ticket**

Your ticket is now created with an auto-generated ticket number (e.g., SUP-001).

## Working on a Ticket

### Adding Comments
Scroll to the comment section and type a response. Comments create a full conversation history on the ticket.

### Changing Status
Tickets move through these statuses:
- **New** — Just created, no one has worked on it
- **In Progress** — Someone is actively working on it
- **On Hold** — Waiting for the requester or a third party
- **Resolved** — Resolution provided
- **Closed** — Fully resolved and closed
- **Cancelled** — Request withdrawn or no longer needed

### Attaching Files
Click the attachment button to upload files (screenshots, documents, logs). Files are stored securely and linked to the ticket.

### Using AI Assist
Click the AI button on any ticket to:
- **Summarize** the full ticket conversation
- **Suggest a response** based on the ticket context and your knowledge base
- **Draft a reply** that you can edit before sending

## Resolving a Ticket

When the issue is resolved:
1. Add a final comment explaining the resolution
2. Change the status to **Resolved**
3. The requester (if linked to a contact) will be notified

If the requester confirms the issue is resolved, change the status to **Closed**.
