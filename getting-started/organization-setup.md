# Setting Up Your Organization

When you sign up for FyneDesk, an organization is created automatically. Here's how to configure it.

## Organization Settings

Go to **Settings > Organization** to configure:

### Organization Name
Your company or team name. This appears in the navigation, email notifications, and your client portal.

### Ticket Prefix
A short code (2-5 characters) used as the prefix for ticket numbers. For example, if you set it to "SUP", your tickets will be numbered SUP-001, SUP-002, etc.

Choose something that makes sense for your team. Common examples:
- `SUP` for support
- `HR` for human resources
- `IT` for IT support
- Your company initials

### Support Email
FyneDesk gives your organization a dedicated support email address in the format: `support-yourslug@fynedesk.io`

When customers send emails to this address, tickets are automatically created. See [Email to Ticket](../features/email-to-ticket.md) for details.

### Timezone and Business Hours
Configure your team's working hours. This affects SLA calculations and reporting.

## Categories

Go to **Settings > Categories** to set up ticket categories. Default categories are created when your organization is set up, but you can customize them:

- Add categories that match your support types (e.g., Billing, Technical, General Inquiry)
- Remove categories you don't need
- Categories help with routing, reporting, and filtering
