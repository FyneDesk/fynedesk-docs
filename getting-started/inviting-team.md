# Inviting Your Team

FyneDesk uses an invitation-based system to add team members. This ensures everyone joins the correct organization and prevents account fragmentation.

## How to Invite

1. Go to **Settings > Team Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Select their role (Admin or Agent)
5. Click **Send Invitation**

The person will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation and create their account.

## Roles

### Admin
Full access to everything:
- All tickets, contacts, and knowledge base articles
- Organization settings, categories, and SLA configuration
- User management (invite, deactivate, change roles)
- Reporting and analytics
- AI Assist

### Agent
Day-to-day support access:
- Create, view, and manage tickets
- Manage contacts and knowledge base articles
- Use AI Assist
- View reporting dashboards

### End User
Limited access for external users:
- Submit and track their own tickets
- View knowledge base articles
- Access through the client portal

## Important Notes

- Only Admins can invite new team members
- Only Admins can change someone's role
- The last Admin in an organization cannot be demoted (this prevents lockout)
- Deactivated users lose access but their ticket history is preserved
- Each invitation is tied to a specific organization, so there's no risk of someone accidentally joining the wrong one
