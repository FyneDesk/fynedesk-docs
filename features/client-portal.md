# Client Support Portal

FyneDesk includes a client-facing support portal where your customers, clients, and end users can submit tickets, track their requests, and find answers in your knowledge base — without needing an internal account.

## What Customers Can Do

- **Submit new tickets** with a title, description, and attachments
- **Track existing tickets** and see status updates
- **Search the knowledge base** for self-service answers
- **Add comments** to their open tickets

## How It Works

The client portal is a separate, clean interface designed for your customers. It doesn't expose your internal tools, team assignments, or admin features.

When a customer submits a ticket through the portal, it appears in your team's ticket queue like any other ticket. Your agents respond, and the customer sees the response in their portal view.

## Access

The portal is available at your organization's portal URL. Share this link with your customers.

## Benefits

- Reduces email volume by giving customers a self-service option
- Provides transparency so customers know their request is being tracked
- Keeps all communication in one place (no lost emails)
- Knowledge base integration helps customers find answers without submitting a ticket
