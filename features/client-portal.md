# Client Support Portal

FyneDesk includes a free customer-facing support portal where your customers, clients, and end users can submit tickets, track their requests, search your knowledge base, and get AI-powered answers without needing an internal account.

## What Customers Can Do

- **Submit new tickets** with a title, description, and attachments
- **Track existing tickets** and see status updates
- **Search the knowledge base** for self-service answers
- **Add comments** to their open tickets

## How It Works

The client portal is a separate, clean interface designed for your customers. It doesn't expose your internal tools, team assignments, or admin features.

When a customer submits a ticket through the portal, it appears in your team's ticket queue like any other ticket. Your agents respond, and the customer sees the response in their portal view.

## Access

The portal is available at your organization's portal URL. Share this link with your customers.

## Portal URL

Each organization gets a dedicated portal at `yourcompany.fynedesk.io`. On Enterprise plans, you can use a custom domain like `support.yourcompany.com`.

## Custom Branding

Customize your portal with your logo, brand colors, and welcome message so it feels like a natural extension of your company.

## Embeddable Website Widget

In addition to the portal, FyneDesk provides an embeddable widget you can add to your website. Customers can submit tickets, search your knowledge base, and get AI-powered answers directly from any page on your site. The widget color and welcome message are customizable.

## CSAT Surveys

After a ticket is resolved, customers can rate their experience through satisfaction surveys. Results are available in your reporting dashboard.

## AI Self-Service

The portal includes AI-powered assistance that helps customers find answers from your knowledge base before they submit a ticket. This reduces ticket volume while keeping customers happy.

## Benefits

- Reduces email volume by giving customers a self-service option
- Provides transparency so customers know their request is being tracked
- Keeps all communication in one place (no lost emails)
- Knowledge base integration helps customers find answers without submitting a ticket
- AI self-service helps customers resolve issues instantly
- Custom branding makes the portal feel like part of your company
