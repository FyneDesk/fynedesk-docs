# Teams

Teams in FyneDesk let you organize your agents into groups based on department, skill, location, or any other criteria. Assign tickets to teams for better routing, workload distribution, and team-level reporting.

## What Are Teams?

A team is a named group of agents within your organization. One agent can belong to multiple teams. Teams give you a way to assign tickets to a group instead of a single person, so the right people see the right work.

## Creating Teams

Admins can create teams from **Settings > Teams**. Each team has a name and a list of members. You can add or remove members at any time.

## Using Teams for Ticket Assignment

When creating or editing a ticket, you can assign it to a team in addition to (or instead of) a specific agent. This is useful when:

- You want any available member of a group to pick up the ticket
- You're routing tickets by department (Billing, Technical, Sales)
- You need to escalate a ticket to a specialized group

## Team-Based Filtering

The ticket list can be filtered by team, so agents can focus on work assigned to their group. This keeps dashboards clean and relevant.

## Reporting by Team

Reports can be broken down by team to see ticket volume, resolution times, and SLA performance for each group. This helps managers identify bottlenecks and balance workload.

## Examples

- **By department:** Billing Team, Technical Support, Sales
- **By skill:** Spanish-speaking agents, Enterprise accounts, Priority escalations
- **By location:** US Support, LATAM Support, Europe Support
- **By function:** Onboarding, Returns, Warranty claims

## Team Members vs. Teams

- **Team members** (profiles) are individual agents and admins in your organization
- **Teams** are groups of those members, used for routing and organization

Every agent belongs to your organization. Teams are an optional layer of structure on top of that.
