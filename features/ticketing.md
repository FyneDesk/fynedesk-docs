# Ticketing

Ticketing is the core of FyneDesk. Every customer request, internal issue, or service inquiry becomes a ticket that your team can track from creation to resolution. FyneDesk's ticketing system includes SLA tracking, email-to-ticket automation, AI-powered assistance, CSAT surveys, response templates, webhooks, and data import.

## Creating Tickets

Tickets can be created in three ways:

1. **Manually** — Any agent or admin can create a ticket from the Tickets page
2. **Email to Ticket** — Customers email your support address and a ticket is created automatically
3. **Client Portal** — Customers submit tickets through your self-service portal

## Ticket Fields

Every ticket includes:

- **Ticket Number** — Auto-generated with your org prefix (e.g., SUP-001)
- **Title** — Short summary of the issue
- **Description** — Full details
- **Status** — New, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved, Closed, Cancelled
- **Priority** — Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Category** — Configurable categories (e.g., Billing, Technical, General)
- **Ticket Type** — Request, Incident, or Question
- **Assigned To** — The agent or team member responsible
- **Requester** — The contact or profile who submitted the request
- **Created At / Updated At** — Timestamps

## Ticket Lifecycle

Tickets follow this flow:

**New** → **In Progress** → **On Hold** (optional) → **Resolved** → **Closed**

- **New**: Just created. No one has started working on it.
- **In Progress**: An agent is actively working on the issue.
- **On Hold**: Waiting on the requester or a third party.
- **Resolved**: A resolution has been provided.
- **Closed**: Confirmed resolved. The ticket is complete.
- **Cancelled**: The request was withdrawn or is no longer needed.

## Comments

Each ticket has a comment thread where agents and requesters can communicate. Comments create a full audit trail of the conversation.

## Activity Log

Every change to a ticket is automatically logged: status changes, priority changes, assignments, and more. This provides a complete audit trail for accountability and reporting.

## Attachments

Agents and requesters can attach files to tickets (screenshots, documents, logs). Files are stored securely and scoped to your organization.

## Filtering and Search

The ticket list supports:
- Filtering by status, priority, category, assignee, and date range
- Sorting by any column
- Pagination for large ticket volumes

## SLA Tracking

FyneDesk tracks key timestamps for SLA measurement:
- **First Response Time** — How quickly an agent first responds
- **Resolution Time** — How long until the ticket is solved
- **Close Time** — When the ticket is fully closed

Configure SLA targets in Settings to measure your team's performance. Advanced SLA escalation rules automatically notify managers or reassign tickets when targets are at risk of being missed.

## Ticket Catalog

Create custom ticket catalog entries that define templates for common request types. When agents or customers create a ticket, they can select from the catalog to pre-fill fields and ensure consistent information is captured.

## Pre-written Response Templates

Save common replies as templates that agents can insert with a click. This speeds up response times for repetitive questions while keeping responses consistent across the team.

## Webhooks

Connect FyneDesk tickets to external tools via webhooks. Integrations with WhatsApp, Slack, Zapier, and custom endpoints let you:
- Get notified in Slack when a new ticket is created
- Send WhatsApp messages to customers when tickets are updated
- Trigger automations in Zapier based on ticket events
- Push ticket data to any custom endpoint

## Data Import

Migrating from another platform? FyneDesk supports importing your existing customer records and ticket history so you can switch without losing your data.

## CSAT Surveys

After tickets are resolved, customers can rate their experience through satisfaction surveys. Track satisfaction scores in your reporting dashboard to identify trends and areas for improvement.
