# Asset Management

FyneDesk includes free built-in asset management for tracking physical and digital assets alongside your support tickets. Most helpdesks (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Help Scout) do not include asset management or charge extra for it. FyneDesk includes it on all plans.

## What Is Asset Management?

Asset management lets you maintain a record of items your organization owns, manages, or supports. Each asset has a type, status, and history of changes. Assets can be linked to tickets, giving your team full context when handling requests about specific items.

## Asset Fields

Each asset includes:

- **Name** (e.g., "MacBook Pro - Marketing Dept")
- **Asset type** (e.g., Laptop, Monitor, Printer, Software License, Vehicle)
- **Serial number**
- **Status** (e.g., Active, In Repair, Retired, In Storage)
- **Assigned to** (which team member or contact is using it)
- **Location**
- **Purchase date** and **warranty expiration**
- **Notes**

## Asset Types

Define custom asset types that match your business. Examples:

- **IT teams:** Laptops, Monitors, Printers, Servers, Software Licenses
- **Facilities:** Furniture, HVAC Units, Access Cards
- **Fleet:** Vehicles, Trailers
- **Healthcare:** Medical Devices, Equipment
- **Distribution:** Refrigeration Units, Delivery Vehicles

Asset types are fully customizable from **Settings > Asset Types**.

## Asset History

Every change to an asset is logged automatically: status changes, reassignments, notes added, and edits. This creates a complete audit trail showing who did what and when.

## Linking Assets to Tickets

When a ticket involves a specific piece of equipment or item, your team can reference the asset. This connects the support request to the asset's full history, making it easier to identify recurring issues or decide whether to repair or replace.

## Searching and Filtering

The asset list supports search by name, serial number, type, status, and assignee. Filter and sort to find assets quickly, even with large inventories.

## Use Cases

- **Customer support:** Track devices or equipment issued to customers
- **IT support:** Manage laptops, monitors, and software licenses assigned to employees
- **Facilities management:** Track office equipment, furniture, and building infrastructure
- **Distribution:** Monitor vehicles, refrigeration units, and delivery equipment
- **Insurance:** Track insured items and their claim history
- **Coworking spaces:** Manage meeting room equipment, printers, and shared devices

## Why Built-In?

Most helpdesk platforms either don't include asset management or charge extra for it (Zendesk requires a marketplace app, Freshdesk doesn't include it, Help Scout doesn't include it). FyneDesk includes asset management on all plans because tracking what you support is just as important as tracking the requests themselves.
