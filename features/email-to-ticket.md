# Email to Ticket

FyneDesk automatically converts incoming emails into support tickets. When a customer emails your dedicated support address, a ticket is created with the email subject as the title, the email body as the description, and the sender matched to an existing contact.

## How It Works

1. Your organization gets a dedicated support email: `support-yourslug@fynedesk.io`
2. When someone sends an email to that address, FyneDesk picks it up automatically
3. A new ticket is created with:
   - **Title** — The email subject line
   - **Description** — The email body
   - **Requester** — Matched to an existing contact by email, or noted for manual linking
4. Your team sees the new ticket in the ticket queue

## Setup

Email to Ticket is configured automatically when your organization is created. Your support email address is shown in **Settings > Organization**.

Share this email address with your customers, put it on your website, and add it to your email signatures. Any email sent to it becomes a ticket.

## What Gets Captured

- Email subject becomes the ticket title
- Email body becomes the ticket description
- Sender email is used to match or identify the requester
- Attachments from the email are attached to the ticket

## Tips

- Add your support email to your website's contact page
- Include it in automated order confirmations and receipts
- Use it as the reply-to address in your customer communications
- Combine with the Knowledge Base so customers can self-serve before emailing
