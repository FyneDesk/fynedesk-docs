# Announcements

Announcements in FyneDesk let your team share internal updates, news, and important information with everyone in the organization. Think of them as a built-in team bulletin board inside your helpdesk.

## What Are Announcements?

Announcements are internal posts visible to all team members in your organization. They are not visible to contacts or customers. Use them for team updates, policy changes, process reminders, shoutouts, or anything your team needs to know.

## Features

- **Rich text content** with formatting
- **Comments** for team discussion on each announcement
- **Reactions** to quickly acknowledge or respond
- **Chronological feed** showing the latest updates first
- **Pinned announcements** for important, long-running notices

## Use Cases

- New process or policy rollout
- System maintenance or downtime notices
- Team wins, milestones, and recognition
- Product updates that affect how tickets are handled
- Reminders about SLA targets or seasonal volume changes
- Onboarding information for new team members

## Who Can Post?

Admins can create and manage announcements. All team members can view, comment, and react.

## Why Announcements Instead of Email?

Important team updates get lost in email. Announcements live inside the tool your team already uses every day. New team members can scroll back and see historical announcements they missed, unlike email which only reaches people who were on the list at the time.
