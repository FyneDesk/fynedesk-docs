# Contacts

Contacts in FyneDesk represent the external people your team supports: customers, clients, end users, patients, students, or anyone outside your organization who submits requests. FyneDesk includes built-in contact management (CRM) that links every contact to their full ticket history, company, and attachments.

## What Are Contacts?

Contacts are separate from your team members (profiles). Your team members are internal users who log in and manage tickets. Contacts are external people whose requests become tickets.

Every contact record stores key information and links to their full interaction history, giving your team context when handling requests.

## Contact Fields

Each contact includes:

- **Name** and **email address**
- **Phone number**
- **Company** (group contacts by their organization)
- **Location**
- **Notes** (internal notes visible only to your team)
- **Ticket history** (every ticket linked to this contact)
- **Attachments** (documents, contracts, or files related to the contact)

## Creating Contacts

Contacts can be created in several ways:

1. **Manually** from the Contacts page
2. **Automatically** when someone sends an email to your support address (matched by email)
3. **Through the customer portal** when a customer submits a ticket
4. **Via data import** when migrating from another platform

## Linking Contacts to Tickets

When creating a ticket, you can set a contact as the **requester**. This links the ticket to the contact's history. When your team opens a contact record, they see every ticket that person has submitted, giving instant context for the current issue.

## Company Grouping

Contacts can be grouped by company. This is useful for B2B support where multiple people from the same company submit requests. You can view all contacts from a specific company and see their combined ticket history.

## Contact Attachments

Attach files to contact records for reference: contracts, agreements, ID documents, configuration files, or anything relevant to ongoing support. These are separate from ticket attachments and persist across all interactions.

## Searching and Filtering

The contacts list supports search by name, email, company, and phone number. Sort and filter to find the right contact quickly, even with thousands of records.

## Data Import

Migrating from another platform? FyneDesk supports importing contact records so you can bring your customer data with you.

## Contacts vs. Team Members

This is an important distinction:

- **Contacts** are external people (your customers, clients, end users)
- **Team members** (profiles) are internal people (your agents and admins)

Contacts don't log into the agent dashboard. They interact through the customer portal, email, or the website widget.
