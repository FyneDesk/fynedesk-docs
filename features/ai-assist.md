# AI Assist

FyneDesk includes built-in AI tools to help your team resolve tickets faster. AI Assist is available on every ticket and uses the ticket context plus your knowledge base to provide relevant help.

## Features

### Summarize
Get a concise summary of the entire ticket conversation. Useful for:
- Agents picking up a ticket they didn't start
- Managers reviewing ticket status
- Long tickets with many comments

### Suggest Response
AI analyzes the ticket and your knowledge base to suggest a relevant response. The suggestion is based on:
- The ticket title and description
- The comment history
- Articles in your knowledge base that match the issue

### Draft Reply
AI drafts a complete reply that you can edit before posting. This saves time on repetitive issues while keeping the human in control.

### Classify
AI suggests a category and priority based on the ticket content. Useful for triaging new tickets quickly.

1. Open any ticket
2. Click the **AI Assist** button
3. Select the action you want (Summarize, Suggest, Draft, Classify)

## Usage Limits

AI Assist usage is tracked per organization to manage costs. Admins can view usage in Settings. The limits are generous for normal support workflows.

## Privacy

AI processing uses the ticket content and your organization's knowledge base articles. No data is shared across organizations. Your ticket data is not used to train AI models.
