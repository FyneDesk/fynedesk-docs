# Notifications

FyneDesk sends email notifications to keep your team informed about ticket activity. Each user controls their own preferences for which events trigger notifications.

## Notification Events

FyneDesk can notify agents and admins when:

- A **ticket is assigned** to them
- A **new comment** is added to a ticket they're assigned to or following
- A **ticket status changes** on a ticket they're involved with
- A **new ticket** is created (for team leads or admins monitoring volume)

## Email Notifications

Notifications are delivered via email. When you receive a notification, you get a clear summary of what happened (who did what on which ticket) with a direct link to the ticket.

## Per-User Preferences

Each team member controls their own notification settings from their **Profile > Notification Preferences**. Notifications can be toggled on or off for each event type. This means agents who prefer to check the dashboard manually can turn off emails, while agents who work from their inbox can keep them on.

## Notification Behavior

- Notifications are scoped to your organization. You only receive notifications about tickets in your own organization.
- You won't receive notifications about your own actions (you won't be emailed when you add a comment to your own ticket).
- Notification emails include the ticket number, title, and a summary of the change.
