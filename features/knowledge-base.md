# Knowledge Base

FyneDesk's Knowledge Base lets you publish help articles that your customers can search and your AI uses to suggest resolutions.

## Creating Articles

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Article**
3. Write your article using the rich text editor (formatting, images, links)
4. Assign it to a category
5. Publish it

## Categories

Organize articles into categories so customers can browse by topic. Manage categories in **Settings > Knowledge Base Categories**.

Examples:
- Getting Started
- Billing & Payments
- Technical Troubleshooting
- Account Management

## Rich Text Editor

The article editor supports:
- Headings, bold, italic, lists
- Links and images
- Code blocks
- Tables

## How Customers Access It

Published knowledge base articles are accessible through your **Client Portal**. Customers can search for answers before submitting a ticket.

## AI Integration

When an agent uses AI Assist on a ticket, the AI searches your knowledge base for relevant articles and uses them to inform its suggestions. This means the more articles you publish, the better AI responses become.

## Tips

- Start with your top 10 most frequently asked questions
- Keep articles short and focused on one topic
- Update articles when processes change
- Use clear, searchable titles
