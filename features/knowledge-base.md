# Knowledge Base

FyneDesk's Knowledge Base lets you publish help articles that your customers can search and your AI uses to suggest resolutions.

## Creating Articles

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Article**
3. Write your article using the rich text editor (formatting, images, links)
4. Assign it to a category
5. Publish it

## Categories

Organize articles into categories so customers can browse by topic. Manage categories in **Settings > Knowledge Base Categories**.

Examples:
- Getting Started
- Billing & Payments
- Technical Troubleshooting
- Account Management

## Rich Text Editor

The article editor supports:
- Headings, bold, italic, lists
- Links and images
- Code blocks
- Tables

## How Customers Access It

Published knowledge base articles are accessible through your **Client Portal**. Customers can search for answers before submitting a ticket.

## AI Integration

The knowledge base is deeply connected to FyneDesk's AI capabilities:

- **AI Suggested Responses** use your articles to provide context-aware reply suggestions on tickets
- **AI Enhanced Search** helps customers find the right article by understanding intent, not just keywords
- **AI Written Articles** let you generate draft articles from ticket resolutions or from scratch, then edit and publish
- **Customer Self-Service AI** on the client portal uses your articles to answer customer questions instantly

The more articles you publish, the better all AI features perform across the platform.

## Internal vs Published Articles

Articles can be set as internal-only (visible only to your team) or published to your client portal for customers to browse. Internal articles are still used by AI Assist when suggesting responses to agents.

## Tips

- Start with your top 10 most frequently asked questions
- Keep articles short and focused on one topic
- Update articles when processes change
- Use clear, searchable titles
