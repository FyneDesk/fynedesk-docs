# Reporting & Analytics

FyneDesk includes free interactive reporting dashboards that help you understand your team's performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. Reports include ticket volume, SLA performance, agent metrics, CSAT scores, and category breakdowns.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard shows a snapshot of your current support operation: open tickets, unassigned tickets, tickets by status, and recent activity. This gives agents and managers an at-a-glance view of what needs attention.

## Report Types

### Ticket Volume
Track how many tickets are created over time. View by day, week, or month. Identify peak periods and plan staffing accordingly.

### Status Distribution
See how tickets are distributed across statuses (New, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved, Closed, Cancelled). Spot bottlenecks where tickets pile up.

### Priority Breakdown
View tickets by priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Understand how much urgent vs. routine work your team handles.

### Category Analysis
Break down tickets by category to see which types of requests are most common. Use this to identify areas where a knowledge base article or process improvement could reduce volume.

### SLA Performance
Track how well your team meets SLA targets for first response time, resolution time, and close time. Identify where SLAs are being missed and why.

### Agent Performance
See ticket counts, resolution times, and workload per agent. Balance work across the team and identify top performers.

### Team Performance
Compare teams against each other on volume, resolution time, and SLA compliance. Useful for organizations with multiple departments or locations.

## Chart Types

FyneDesk reports use interactive charts including area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and composed charts. Hover over data points for details. Charts update in real time as new data comes in.

## Filtering

All reports can be filtered by:

- **Date range** (last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range)
- **Status**
- **Priority**
- **Category**
- **Assigned agent or team**

## CSAT Reports

When CSAT surveys are enabled, satisfaction scores are tracked and reported alongside ticket metrics. See overall satisfaction trends, scores by agent, and scores by category.

## Exporting

Report data can be exported for use in external tools or for sharing with stakeholders.

## Who Uses Reports?

- **Agents** use the dashboard to see their workload and priorities
- **Team leads** use team and agent reports to balance work and coach
- **Managers** use SLA and volume reports to plan staffing and identify process improvements
- **Executives** use summary reports to track support quality over time
