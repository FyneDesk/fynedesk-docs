# How to Use AI Assist

FyneDesk includes AI-powered features to help your team respond faster, write better, and reduce repetitive work. This guide explains each AI capability and how to use it effectively.

## AI for Agents

### Ticket Summarization
When a ticket has a long conversation thread with multiple comments, AI summarization condenses it into a brief overview. This saves time when picking up tickets you didn't start or when reviewing a ticket before responding.

**When to use it:** Open a ticket with 5+ comments and click the summarize button to get a quick overview instead of reading every message.

### Suggested Responses
AI analyzes the ticket content and your knowledge base to suggest a relevant response. The suggestion is a starting point, not a final answer. Review it, adjust the tone and details, and send it. This is faster than writing from scratch.

**When to use it:** When you're handling a common question that's covered in your knowledge base, or when you need a starting point for a reply.

### Draft Replies
AI generates a full draft reply based on the ticket context. This goes further than a suggestion by producing a ready-to-edit message. Review and personalize before sending.

**When to use it:** For routine tickets where the response follows a pattern. Edit the draft to add specifics before sending.

### Ticket Classification
AI can suggest a category, priority, or type for incoming tickets based on the content. This helps with routing and ensures tickets are categorized consistently, especially during high-volume periods.

**When to use it:** When triaging a batch of new tickets and you want consistent categorization.

## AI for Customers

### AI on the Customer Portal
When enabled, customers can ask questions on your portal and receive instant answers generated from your published knowledge base articles. If the answer resolves their question, they don't need to submit a ticket. If it doesn't, they can still create one.

**Impact:** This reduces ticket volume by helping customers find answers themselves. The more complete your knowledge base is, the better the AI answers become.

### AI-Enhanced Search
Customers searching your knowledge base get AI-enhanced results that understand intent, not just keywords. Searching for "can't log in" will surface articles about password resets, account access, and authentication even if those articles don't contain the exact phrase "can't log in."

## AI for Knowledge Base

### AI-Generated Articles
AI can help draft knowledge base articles based on common ticket patterns. If your team answers the same question repeatedly, AI can generate an article covering that topic, which your team then reviews, edits, and publishes.

**When to use it:** When you identify a frequent question that should be in the knowledge base but nobody has had time to write the article.

## Usage and Limits

AI usage is tracked per organization. Each plan includes a set number of AI interactions per month. Usage is visible in your settings so you can monitor consumption.

## Tips for Better AI Results

- **Maintain a good knowledge base:** AI suggestions and customer-facing answers are only as good as the content they're built on. Keep articles accurate, up to date, and comprehensive.
- **Write clear ticket descriptions:** AI performs better when tickets have descriptive titles and detailed descriptions.
- **Review before sending:** AI drafts are a starting point, not a final answer. Always review for accuracy, tone, and relevance before sending to a customer.
- **Use categories consistently:** AI classification works better when your category structure is clear and logical.

## Privacy

AI features process ticket and knowledge base content to generate responses. Your data is not shared with other organizations and is not used to train models. AI processing respects your organization's data boundaries.
