# How to Set Up Your Customer Portal

The FyneDesk customer portal gives your customers a self-service interface where they can submit tickets, check the status of existing requests, search your knowledge base, and interact with AI-powered answers.

## What Is the Customer Portal?

The customer portal is a public-facing website for your customers. It's separate from the agent dashboard (where your team works). Customers access the portal to:

- Submit new support requests
- Check the status of their open tickets
- View their full ticket history
- Search published knowledge base articles
- Get instant AI-powered answers before submitting a ticket
- Respond to tickets and add comments

## Accessing Your Portal

Your portal is automatically available at **yourorganization.fynedesk.io**. The URL uses your organization's slug, which is set during signup.

On the Enterprise plan, you can use a custom domain (e.g., support.yourcompany.com).

## What Customers See

### Ticket Submission Form
A clean form where customers enter their name, email, subject, description, and optionally select a category. On plans with the embeddable widget, this form can also appear directly on your website.

### Ticket Status Tracking
After submitting, customers can check back to see the status of their request (New, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved, Closed). They can also add comments or provide additional information.

### Knowledge Base Search
Published knowledge base articles are searchable from the portal. Customers can find answers on their own before submitting a ticket.

### AI Self-Service
When AI is enabled for the portal, customers can ask questions and receive instant answers generated from your knowledge base articles. If the AI answer doesn't resolve their issue, they can still submit a ticket.

## Setting Up the Portal

1. **Publish knowledge base articles:** Go to the Knowledge Base and mark articles as published. Only published articles appear on the portal.
2. **Organize categories:** Create logical categories so customers can browse topics.
3. **Share the URL:** Add your portal link to your website, email signatures, and anywhere customers look for help.
4. **Test the experience:** Visit your portal URL and try submitting a ticket, searching the knowledge base, and asking the AI a question.

## Custom Branding

On paid plans, you can customize the portal with your logo, brand colors, and a welcome message. This makes the portal feel like part of your own website rather than a third-party tool.

## Embeddable Widget

FyneDesk includes an embeddable widget that you can add to your own website. Customers can access the portal's features (submit tickets, search KB, get AI answers) without leaving your site. The widget is a small code snippet you paste into your website's HTML.

## Tips

- **Write good knowledge base articles:** The more complete your KB is, the more customers can self-serve and the fewer tickets your team needs to handle.
- **Keep categories simple:** 5-10 clear categories are better than 50 granular ones. Customers should be able to pick the right category without hesitation.
- **Link from your website:** Add a "Get Help" or "Support" link in your website's navigation or footer that points to your portal.
- **Monitor portal submissions:** Tickets submitted through the portal have the same priority and visibility as email tickets. Triage them the same way.
