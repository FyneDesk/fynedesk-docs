# Themes & Customization

FyneDesk includes 5 color themes to customize the look of your workspace. Themes affect the navigation, buttons, links, and accent colors throughout the agent dashboard.

## Available Themes

- **Blue** — Clean and professional (default)
- **Slate** — Neutral and understated
- **Teal** — Fresh and modern
- **Purple** — Bold and distinctive
- **Orange** — Warm and energetic

## How to Change the Theme

Go to **Settings > Appearance** and select a theme. The change applies immediately across your workspace for all users in the organization.

## What Themes Affect

Themes change the primary accent color used in:

- Navigation sidebar
- Buttons and interactive elements
- Links and highlights
- Selected/active states
- Chart colors in reports

## What Themes Do Not Affect

Some colors are fixed for clarity and should never change with the theme:

- **Status badges:** Green for resolved, red for critical, yellow for on hold
- **Priority indicators:** Red for critical, orange for high, blue for medium, gray for low
- **Error and success messages:** Red for errors, green for success
- **System alerts and warnings**

These stay consistent regardless of theme to avoid confusion.

## Customer Portal Branding

On paid plans, the customer portal can be customized separately with your own logo, brand colors, and welcome message. This is independent of the agent dashboard theme.
