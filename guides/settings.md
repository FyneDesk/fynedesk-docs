# Settings & Configuration

FyneDesk gives Admins a centralized settings area to configure how the platform works for their organization.

## Organization Settings

- **Organization name:** The name displayed in the navigation, customer portal, and email notifications.
- **Organization slug:** Used in your support email address (support-yourslug@fynedesk.io) and customer portal URL. Set during signup.
- **Ticket prefix:** A short code (2-5 characters) prepended to ticket numbers (e.g., SUP-001, HR-042). Makes tickets easy to reference in conversations.
- **Support email:** Your organization's dedicated email address for email-to-ticket. Shown in settings for reference.

## Ticket Categories

Categories organize tickets by topic. Default categories are created when your organization is set up. Admins can add, rename, or remove categories from **Settings > Categories**.

Examples: General Inquiry, Billing, Technical Issue, Account Access, Returns, Onboarding.

Categories appear in the ticket creation form, filter dropdowns, and reporting dashboards.

## Ticket Statuses

FyneDesk uses six ticket statuses:

- **New** — Just created, not yet looked at
- **In Progress** — Being actively worked on
- **On Hold** — Waiting for information or an external dependency
- **Resolved** — The issue has been addressed
- **Closed** — Confirmed complete, no further action needed
- **Cancelled** — Ticket was withdrawn or is no longer relevant

Statuses drive SLA tracking (first response, resolution, close timestamps are recorded automatically).

## Ticket Priorities

Four priority levels:

- **Critical** — Requires immediate attention
- **High** — Important, should be addressed soon
- **Medium** — Standard priority (default)
- **Low** — Can be addressed when time allows

## Ticket Types

Classify tickets by type to distinguish between different kinds of requests. Examples: Question, Incident, Problem, Request, Feedback.

## SLA Configuration

Set targets for:

- **First response time** — How quickly your team should first respond to a new ticket
- **Resolution time** — How quickly the issue should be resolved
- **Close time** — How quickly resolved tickets should be closed

SLA performance is tracked automatically and visible in the reporting dashboard.

## Asset Types

Admins can define custom asset types from **Settings > Asset Types**. Examples: Laptop, Monitor, Printer, Software License, Vehicle, Medical Device.

## Theme

Choose from 5 color themes: Blue, Slate, Teal, Purple, or Orange. The theme applies across the entire workspace for all users in the organization.
