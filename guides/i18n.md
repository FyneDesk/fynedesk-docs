# Multi-Language Support

FyneDesk supports 20+ languages, allowing teams around the world to work in their preferred language. This makes FyneDesk one of the most internationally accessible free helpdesk platforms available.

## Supported Languages

English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Hindi, Korean, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and more.

## How It Works

The entire agent interface (navigation, labels, buttons, form fields, status names, priority names, system messages) is translated into each supported language. Users see FyneDesk in the language configured for the application.

## Setting the Language

Language settings are applied at the application level. The interface language affects all labels, menu items, and system text.

## What Gets Translated

- Navigation menus and page titles
- Ticket form labels (status, priority, category, type)
- Button text (Save, Cancel, Create, Delete, Assign)
- System messages and confirmations
- Dashboard labels and report headers
- Settings pages
- Empty state messages

## What Is Not Translated

- **User-generated content:** Ticket titles, descriptions, comments, knowledge base articles, and contact names stay in whatever language they were written in
- **Marketing and landing pages:** The FyneDesk marketing website is in English only
- **Custom category and team names:** These are set by your organization and stay as entered

## Adding a Language

FyneDesk's language support is maintained by the development team. If you need a language that isn't currently supported, contact FyneDesk to request it.

## Right-to-Left (RTL) Support

Languages like Arabic that read right-to-left are supported with appropriate layout adjustments.

## Use Cases

- **International teams:** A team in Brazil can use FyneDesk in Portuguese while a team in Germany uses it in German
- **Latin American support:** Spanish and Portuguese for teams serving customers across LATAM
- **Global companies:** Support agents in different countries work in their native language
- **Multilingual businesses:** Serve customers in their language while your team works in theirs
